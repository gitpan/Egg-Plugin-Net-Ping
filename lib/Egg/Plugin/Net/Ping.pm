=head1 NAME

Egg::Plugin::Net::Ping - Net::Ping for Egg plugin.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Egg qw/ Net::Ping /;
  
  __PACKAGE__->egg_startup(
    ...
    .....
    plugin_net_ping => {
      protcol => 'tcp',
      timeout => 3,
      retry   => 1,
      wait    => 0.5,
      },
    );

  if ( $e->ping('192.168.1.1') ) {
    print " Ping was answered. !! ";
  } else {
    print " There is no answer to Ping. ";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is a plug-in to investigate while arbitrary PC is operating by L<Net::Ping>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Please set 'plugin_net_ping'.

=head2 protcol

They are the protocols such as tcp and udp.

Default is 'tcp'.

* I do not think that it operates well perhaps excluding tcp.

=head2 timeout

Time to wait for answer of ping.

Default is '3'.

=head2 retry

Frequency in which ping is done.

=head2 wait

Waiting time to doing next retry.

Default is '0.5'.

=head2 self_addr

Own host address.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ping ( [TARGET_HOST], [ARGS_HASH] )

Ping is sent to TARGET_HOST, and the succeeding frequency is returned.

ARGS_HASH overwrites initialization.

* When retry is set to five times or more, five is compulsorily set.

  $e->ping('192.168.1.111', retry => 5 );
